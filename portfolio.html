            <p class="education-desc">I attended Cornell University from Fall 2019 to Spring 2023, majoring in Computer
                Science in the College of Engineering. Cornell has been a very important and informative experience in
                my life. I have met and made memories with lifelong friends that I will cherish forever. Academically, I
                have taken extensive Computer Science courses ethat will assist me in industry, as well as Math courses
                that honed my logical reasoning. Below are some of the relevant courses that I have taken.

            <p class="http_server_text">Inspired by the work I did during the summer of 2021 at Onto Innovation, I
                wanted to continue developing
                my skills with C development. Creating a simple local server/client system would give me the opportunity
                to both practice C and get more familiar with networking. This was a fun and interesting learning
                experience and the repo can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/myy22/TCP-IP-pthread">github</a>.

            <h1 id="meta-section" class="section-header">Meta Internship (SDE Intern)</h1>
            <p class="meta-desc">I was fortunate to be able to intern at Meta as a Software Development Engineer Intern
                during the summer of 2022. I worked in person in the headquarters in Menlo Park. This was an extremely
                valuable experience because I was able to work on actual code being used at the company. I was also able
                to work with and receive mentorship from Engineers that have been working in the field for over a
                decade. The internship was challenging, but rewarding and I was constantly learning new things almost
                every day. I am very excited to workin industry and further improve myself as a software engineer. Below
                is a quick presentation about the technical work that I did over the summer.</p>
