            <h1 id="hello-world-section" class="section-header">Hello World</h1>
            <p class="hello-world-desc">Here I record a quick tutorial going over how to implement the classic
                "Hello World" function that almost every beginning programmer learns. This entails printing the
                statement "Hello World" to the console. This is to demonstrate my familiarity with IDEs such as VSCode
                and my familiarity with the Python language. I chose to use Python because it is a very simple language
                to understand and ideal for writing quick scripts such as this. In my internship I often found myself
                writing quick Python scripts for data processing and helping with simple tasks that could be automated.
                Python is a great addition to my programming skills and helps me perform to the highest degree.

            <h1 id="data-structures-section" class="section-header">Data Structures</h1>
            <p class="data-structures-desc">Here I record a quick presentation going over some basic data structures
                such as arrays and sets that are useful in practice for their unique properties. Being a software
                engineer is ultimately a problem solving job, where one uses their prior knowledge to come to efficient
                and elegant solutions. On one hand is the hard programming skills for writing code that is well
                organized and logically sound. However, just as important is the theoretical knowledge that backs this
                up. This includes knowledge about industry practices, libraries, lower level computer
                design/architecture, and essential programming concepts (ie data structures, recursion, dynamic
                programming, etc). I demonstrate my knowledge of one of the most fundamental building blocks of
                Computer Science which is the data structure.</p>
